Errata for SumYld_Residue_99-14_ARDEC_Halvorson.xlsx

1.  N source for 2014 should be Urea instead of SuperU
2.  N source for 2012 should be SuperU instead of ESN.  (Urea is correct for N treatment 2.)

By comparing the 2013 plant results for plot 73, I found that cob and stalk yields were taken from the biomass operation, and grain yields (both OD and 15.5%) were taken from the harvest operation.  Thus, biomass grain values do not appear in this summary.  In my SAS datasets, I will retain this convention.

	Corn 15.5%
	Barley 12%
	Soybean 13%
